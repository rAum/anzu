[![CI Action Status](https://github.com/rAum/anzu/workflows/anzu%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/rAum/anzu/actions)


## What 
Experimental space to test some ideas and implement some handy functions.

## Why
Main motivation is to create a library which can be used as building blocks for computer vision/graphics apps. This comes from my need that many times I had to implement some routines but they are all "wasted" due to NDA agreements.
Currently there are great ML libs so my main focus is on "classical" approaches.

Last "why" is simple - just fool around and test some assumptions.

## How
Design goals is to provide multiple "blocks", do not pessimize performance and be easy to setup, including thirdparty.
Blocks should be from different level of abstraction to allow more experimental freedom.
Finally visual helpers for seeing what is going on/gui tools are also quite important for me.
However the "easy to use" is not the goal in itself as there are lot of libraries that focus on that.
It would be also nice to have really good documentation and tutorials.

Aside of being a playground, as byproduct of testing I plan to implement some apps to test in the wild.

In the end, all of this is just initial thoughts I have.

## Other notes
Currently I switched to focus mostly on [vilga](https://github.com/rAum/vilga) development as I think I need to boostrap some handy viz tool and it could be more useful for my other projects.
